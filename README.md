# Text-Generation-Model---LSTM-GPT-Implementation
LSTMs (RNNs) generate text sequentially, learning long-range dependencies via internal gates for next-word prediction. GPT (Transformer) uses self-attention for parallel processing and vast pre-training, enabling highly coherent, context-aware text generation by predicting the next token, excelling in scalability and quality.
